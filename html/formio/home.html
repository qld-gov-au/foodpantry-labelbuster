    Label Buster is a step-by-step guide to help you identify information you need
    to create a food label that meets Australian requirements. At the end, you
    will have generated a product sheet you can give to a printer to design a
    label for you and an example of what your food label should look like.

    The
    <a href="">
      <span class="title">Australia New Zealand Food Standards Code</span>

    (the Food Standards Code) sets the standards for food labelling in Australia.
    Significant penalties apply in Queensland under the Food Act 2006 (the Act),
    for non-compliance with the Food Standards Code.

    Who can use Label Buster?
  </h2>
  <p>
    Label Buster is designed for small to medium food businesses. If your food has
    complex labelling requirements, such as infant formula, sports supplements or
    alcohol, the tool does not provide all the information you need, and you are
    recommended to seek professional legal advice from a food labelling
    consultant.
