        The Food Standards Code specifies how to list food additives in the ingredient list. This includes a list of
        class names and codes to use for specific food additives.
        <br />
        For example: The ingredient list would show the yellow food colouring tartrazine as either:
        <ul>
            <li>Colour (tartrazine), or </li>
            <li>Colour (102)</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
