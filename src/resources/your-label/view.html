  <h2>Example of food label</h2>
  <p>
    Below is an example of what your label could look like, using the information you provided in Label Buster. Label
    components can be placed anywhere on the label you create. They do not need to be in the specific layout shown here.
    They may be displayed in any order or arrangement
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Legibility requirements</h2>
  <p>
    All required words, statements, expressions or designs provided on a food label must be in English, be legible, and
    be
    prominent so as to contrast distinctly with the background of the label.
  </p>
  <p>
    Information in other languages is permitted, provided it does not negate or contradict the English information.
  </p>
  <p>
    No specific print type or size is defined for general labelling requirements, however:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      warning statements must be in a type size of at least 3mm (or 1.5mm on small packages)
    </li>
    <li>
      a print size is prescribed in the Food Standards Code for some foods where a required statement must be shown
      (e.g.
      infant formula).
    </li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
