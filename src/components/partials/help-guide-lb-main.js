          <p>
          Nutrition, health and related claims are voluntary statements made by food 
          businesses on labels and in advertising about the content 
          of certain nutrients or substances in a food, or the relationship between 
          food and health.
          </p>
          <p> Claims cannot be made about: </br>
            <ul>
              <li>
                kava
              </li>
              <li>
               infant formula
              </li>
              <li>
              any food that contains more than 1.15% alcohol by volume, other than a
              nutrition content claim about energy, carbohydrate or gluten content; 
              or salt or sodium content about a food that is not a beverage.              
              </li>              
            </ul>
          </p>

        <p>
        <b>Health Claims</b> </br>
        <p>
         Health claims refer to a relationship between a food and health. For example:
        </p>
          <ul>
          <li>
          Calcium for bones and teeth
          </li>
          <li>
            Diets high in calcium may reduce the risk of osteoporosis in people 65 years and over          
            </li>          
          </ul>
          <p>
          Health claims are not permitted on foods that are high in saturated fat, sugar or salt.</br>
          There are lists of pre-approved food-health relationships that businesses can base their 
          claims on. These are listed in <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/Series/F2015L00474" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Schedule 4 of the Code</a>.
          </p>
        </p> 

        <p><b>Nutrition content claims</b>
        <p>
          Nutrition content claims indicate the presence or absence of certain nutrients or substances 
          in the food, for example, ‘low in fat’ or ‘good source of calcium’. These claims will need to 
          meet certain criteria set out in the Standard. For example, 
          food with a ‘good source of calcium’ claim will need to contain not less than the amount of 
          calcium specified in the Standard.
        </p>
        
        <b>Endorsements</b>
        <p>
          An endorsement is a nutrition content claim or health claim that is made with the 
          permission of an endorsing body, for example the Heart Foundation Tick.
        </p>
        
        <b>Consumer value claims</b>
        <p>
          Other consumer value claims such as cage free; organic or locally grown are covered
          by Australian Competition and Consumer Commission.
