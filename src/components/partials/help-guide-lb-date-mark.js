            A date mark is a guide to how long a food will last. All packaged
            food with a shelf life of two years or less must show a date mark,
            except for individual portions of ice cream or ice confection.
          </p>
          <p>Shelf life refers to the length of time a food remains:</p>

            It may be necessary to seek expert advice from a food testing
            laboratory:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>to determine your food’s shelf life</li>
            <li>
              to determine what type of date mark is required for your food.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The Food Standards Code gives rules for the
            <button data-accordion-item="date-format" class="accordion-btn">
              format of the date mark
            </button>
            (how it appears on label). The day and month are required for a food
            with a shelf life of 3 months or less, whereas the month and year
            are required for a food with a longer shelf life.

            A best-before date is the last date on which you can expect a food
            to look, smell and taste fresh, and to keep any property for which a
            claim has been made. This is on the condition that the food has been
            stored according to any storage conditions on the label and the
            package is unopened.
          </p>
          <p>
            A food that has passed its best-before date will still be safe to
            eat.
          </p>
          <p>
            The words ‘Best Before’ must be included on the label followed by
            the date, or a direction provided about where the date is located.
            For example:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Best Before 23 Dec 2021</li>
            <li>Best Before – see base of can</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Foods may be sold after the best-before date if the food has not
            spoiled and complies with any other applicable legislation.

            The day, month and year must be written so that it is clear which
            number refers to the day, the month or the year.
          </p>
          <p>The month can be expressed in either:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>numerical form, e.g. 01 for January; or</li>

            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>The year can be expressed in numerical form using either:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>2 digits, e.g. 21; or</li>
            <li>4 digits, e.g. 2021.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The date format depends on the shelf life of the food. The day and
            month (e.g. 15/03/2020) are required for a food with a shelf life of
            3 months or less. The month and year (e.g.: Apr 2021) are required
            for a food with a longer shelf life.

            Lot identification means a number or other information that
            identifies the premises where the food was prepared or packed, and
            the batch the food is part of. This may be useful when several
            batches of the same food are prepared, manufactured or packed on the
            same day. There is no set format for lot identification.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is not always necessary to include a lot identification on a
            label if a date mark, business name and address can identify the
            food. If date marking is not required, lot identification must be
            added so that the food can be identified.

            The use-by date is the date after which the food should not be eaten

            For example, milk is usually labelled with a use-by date because it

          </p>
          <p>
            You will need to determine the shelf life of your food to work out
            how long it can be safely stored. It is recommended you seek
            professional advice from a food testing laboratory.

            The words ‘Use By’ must be included on the label followed by the
